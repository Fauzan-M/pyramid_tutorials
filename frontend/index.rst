Modern Frontend Development with Pyramid REST
=============================================

Web applications are shifting more development to the browser, from the
server-side backend to the client-side frontend.

This tutorial shows a selection of frontend-oriented technologies,
used with Pyramid REST endpoints, as part of a highly-productive,
UI-centric development process. Specifically, we do an AngularJS ToDo
frontend talking to a Pyramid backend, managed by Nix.
