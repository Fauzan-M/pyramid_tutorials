==========================================
Basic Frontend with NodeJS, npm, and bower
==========================================

- Get NodeJS, npm, and bower into the isolated environment

Old Style
=========

- Install NodeJS

- Presumes npm and bower (then later, gulp) are in your global node
  environment

- ``npm install``

- ``bower install``

Rok Questions
=============

- I'm still using package.json/npm for NodeJS libraries and
  bower.json/bower for JS libraries...almost none of these are in
  nixpkgs
