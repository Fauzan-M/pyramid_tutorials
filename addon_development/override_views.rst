================================
Override Views and Static Assets
================================

*Base add-on with views and static assets that can be customized by
overriding.*

- Imagine you have a form library such as Deform and a ready-to-go
  application such as Plone

- In your site, you want those addons to wire up any views or
  CSS/JS/PNG needed so that you don't have to know the inner details

- But you might want control over the URLs used

- Or, you might want to replace individual pieces
