=============================
Frontend Automation with Gulp
=============================

- Smallest possible step


Old Style
=========

- Assumes gulp is installed globally

- Get a few gulp plugins into package.json

- ``npm install``

- Create gulpfile.js

- Run default task with ``gulp`` (just fires up a webserver that
  serves up current directory)

Rok Questions
=============

- I see from https://www.mail-archive.com/nix-commits@lists.science.uu
.nl/msg12445.html that gulp is part of some package in some collection?

- Is it possible that a lot of gulp plugins are in some meta package?

- I'm still using package.json/npm for NodeJS libraries and
  bower.json/bower for JS libraries...almost none of these are in
  nixpkgs
